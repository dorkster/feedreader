## Usage

Feeds are added via a file called `rssfeeds` in located in the user's `$HOME/.config/feedreader` folder.

This file will not be created automatically, so it is up to the user to do so.

The config file follows a `key=value` format. Comments are lines beginning with `#`. It uses the following keys:

| Key             | Description
|-----------------|----------------
| browser         | An executable to launch when clicking on an article.
| update_interval | The amount of time (in seconds) between automatic refreshes.
| max_articles    | The maxiumum number of articles to show per feed.
| feed            | Two values, separated by a comma. The first value is the title to be displayed for this feed. The second is the URL of a valid RSS feed. This key can be used multiple times to add more feeds.
