# feedreader
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

feedreader is a light-weight RSS reader that sits in the user's system tray.



## Dependencies & Building

* GTK2
* libxml2.

To compile feedreader, simply run `make` in the base directory.



## Usage

Feeds are added via a file called `rssfeeds` in located in the user's `$HOME/.config/feedreader` folder.

This file will not be created automatically, so it is up to the user to do so.

The layout is one feed per line with the following format:

`Feed Title\Feed URL`

Example:

`My Favorite RSS\http://www.example.com/feed.rss`
